  The Tribe Conference is a marketing conference for people who don't think of
  themselves as marketers. It's a gathering for writers, artists, and creative
  entrepreneurs to grow their craft, share their work, and get the attention
  their work deserves. Here are some of my highlights of the conference. The
  next conference is Sept. 16-18 2016 I hope you can attend. For more details
