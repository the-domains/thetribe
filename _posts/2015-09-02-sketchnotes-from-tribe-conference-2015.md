description: "This past weekend I had the pleasure of attending Tribe Conference, a great event put on by Jeff Goins and his team. Tribe was the best bang-for-your-buck conference I've ever attended, an amazing value for the community and speakers present. One way I was happy to contribute was with my sketchnotes."
