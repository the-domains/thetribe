So this past weekend Julia and I attended the first ever Tribe Conference. This event was organzine by my friend Jeff Goins, and I was not sure what to expect. I think the summary is best explained this way:

The Tribe Conference is a marketing conference for people who don't think of themselves as marketers. It's a gathering for writers, artists, and creative entrepreneurs to grow their craft, share their work, and get the attention their work deserves. 

It's a large-scale workshop that will give you a roadmap to find your tribe and give you the space to implement it.This two-day event is packed full of inspiring speakers, practical content, and unforgettable experiences. But this is more than an event.
You'll set into motion a plan you can keep improving on for years to come. 

You won't leave the Tribe Conference with a notebook full of ideas and nothing checked off your to-do list. 
So with that being said, what did we take away from the conference. http://tribeconference.com/
