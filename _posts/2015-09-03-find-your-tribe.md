# FIND YOUR TRIBE

So this past weekend Julia and I attended the first ever Tribe Conference. The Tribe Conference is a marketing conference for people who don't think of themselves as marketers. It's a gathering for writers, artists, and creative entrepreneurs to grow their craft, share their work, and get the attention their work deserves.
