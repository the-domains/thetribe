# Find Your Tribe

So this past weekend Julia and I attended the first ever Tribe Conference. This event was organzine by my friend Jeff Goins, and I was not sure what to expect.
The Tribe Conference is a marketing conference for people who don't think of themselves as marketers. It's a gathering for writers, artists, and creative entrepreneurs to grow their craft, share their work, and get the attention their work deserves. 
It's a large-scale workshop that will give you a roadmap to find your tribe and give you the space to implement it.This two-day event is packed full of inspiring speakers, practical content, and unforgettable experiences. But this is more than an event.
You'll set into motion a plan you can keep improving on for years to come. You won't leave the Tribe Conference with a notebook full of ideas and nothing checked off your to-do list. 

So with that being said, what did we take away from the conference. Here are my TOP TEN take away's.

2\. "Embrace the mess"- @JeffGoins 

3\. "Dying is easy...living is the hard part." -@allyvest

4\. All communication is marketing. Everything you write, do, and say.

5\. "Don't build your business on someone else's platform." - @Harris\_Bryan 

6\. "Money is created when someone finds value. Value is created when someone trusts the product. Trust is created when someone believes in your experience." -@WhitneyEnglish 

7\. "Tell the story of who you are with your whole heart." -@joebunting
8."You will never regret helping people"-@joshua\_becker 

9\. "Who I am is more important than what I do"- @grantbaldwin 

10."Art in the Heart is a stewardship to share with others." @MichaelHyatt
