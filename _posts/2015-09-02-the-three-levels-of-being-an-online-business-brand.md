# The Three Levels Of Being An Online Business Brand

In the online business space, there are a lot of big name brands. People everyone knows and whose names we frequently throw around as success stories and case studies.

When someone wants to start an online business, they often look to these big names as examples of what they want to build someday.

I want to have a blog, a podcast, a course, a membership community, a SAAS app, a fancy autoresponder sequence, speaking engagements and a bestselling book that teaches people something about having a business, chasing a passion, and have an awesomely awesome life of awesomeness.

We want that because that's what the big names have. But those big names are often at level 3 of the game.

Like with anything in life, you can't get to level 3 without first going through level 2 and you can't get to level 2 without going through level 1\.

Seems simple enough right?

_Grant, what the crap are you talking about with these levels?_

I'm glad you asked.

**Level 1 in business requires that you get really good at something.**

**Level 2 is that you teach what you learned in level 1\.**

**Level 3 allows you to move to other markets and niches.**
