When someone wants to start an online business, they often look to these big names as examples of what they want to build someday.

I want to have a blog, a podcast, a course, a membership community, a SAAS app, a fancy autoresponder sequence, speaking engagements and a bestselling book that teaches people something about having a business, chasing a passion, and have an awesomely awesome life of awesomeness.

We want that because that's what the big names have. But those big names are often at level 3 of the game.

Like with anything in life, you can't get to level 3 without first going through level 2 and you can't get to level 2 without going through level 1\.

Seems simple enough right?

_Grant, what the crap are you talking about with these levels?_

I'm glad you asked.

**Level 1 in business requires that you get really good at something.**

**Level 2 is that you teach what you learned in level 1\.**

**Level 3 allows you to move to other markets and niches.**
