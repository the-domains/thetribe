**The Tribe Conference is a marketing conference for people who don't think of themselves as marketers.**It's a gathering for **writers, artists, and creative entrepreneu**rs to grow their craft, share their work, and get the attention their work deserves.

This three-day event is packed full of inspiring speakers, practical content, and unforgettable experiences. But this is more than an event. It's a **large-scale workshop** that will give you a roadmap to find your tribe and give you the space to implement it.

You won't leave the Tribe Conference with a notebook full of ideas and nothing checked off your to-do list. **You'll set into motion a plan you can keep improving on for years to come.**
