# Never Write Alone
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/331367f2-7134-4802-b5a5-530f08a97002.jpg)

Instant access to a wealth of information and digital tools broke down the walls of traditional publishing. The good news is anyone can write a book. This is also the bad news.

Steven Pressfield Shawn Coyne

The Internet provides the means for anyone to write, market, and launch their own book. Anyone who thinks they are a writer can self-publish a mediocre title with relative ease.

People who fool themselves into believing they've found a secret hack to writing success are cheating. And in the long run, cheaters never win.

You wouldn't want a neurosurgeon who cheated off his classmates to operate on you. Nor do you want to read a book written by someone who disrespects the craft.

There are no shortcuts to becoming a writer.

This week on The Portfolio Life, Steven Pressfield, Shawn Coyne and I talk about the Resistance, what it's like to write a New York Times bestseller, why rejection is healthy, and how we can find meaning and direction in our work as authors.

Listen in as we discuss the origin of The War of Art, why the ease of digital publishing is dangerous, and interesting aspects of the writer-editor relationship.

### The priceless quality of an incredible editor

_The Art of Work_, is outperforming all of my previous books combined. The reason is simple. I found a great editor who helped me understand my own ideas with better clarity and context.

I've talked before about the key to building your tribe revolving around the concept of finding the "sweet spot". The intersection of your passion and skill with what the market values.

While writing _The Art of Work_, I was passionate about the topic and skilled in the concepts. My editor helped me distill the message so it resonated with readers. We make a great team.

One of the things I found most interesting about Steven and Shawn is their authenticity with each other and their audience. They are not afraid to challenge conventional thinking and share their "secrets" with whoever will listen.
