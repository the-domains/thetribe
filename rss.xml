            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Shoshin: This Zen Concept Will Help You Stop Being a Slave to Old Behaviors and Beliefs</h1><p>I played baseball for 17 years of my life.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Allison Vesterfelt - Discover The Power of Your Voice</h1><p>I read an article this week about another leader who was found to be having an affair. This time a university president. Apparently the man's son caught footage of his father on his cell phone camera, and well, I think you can imagine how things went from there.</p><img src="http://allisonvesterfelt.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/leaders.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Your Mistakes Don't Define You, They Teach You</h1><p>Sometimes, I even amaze myself at how many things I can screw up in a short amount of time. Just the other day, a friend pointed out I had inadvertently plagiarized his work on my blog. He was beyond gracious about it, but I was mortified.</p><img src="http://goinswriter.com/wp-content/uploads/plane-crash.jpg"></article>]]></description>
