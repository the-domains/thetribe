            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Find Your Tribe</h1><p>The Tribe Conference is a marketing conference for people who don't think of themselves as marketers. It's a gathering for writers, artists, and creative entrepreneurs to grow their craft, share their work, and get the attention their work deserves. Here are some of my highlights of the conference. The next conference is Sept. 16-18 2016 I hope you can attend.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Shoshin: This Zen Concept Will Help You Stop Being a Slave to Old Behaviors and Beliefs</h1><p>I played baseball for 17 years of my life.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Allison Vesterfelt - Discover The Power of Your Voice</h1><p>I read an article this week about another leader who was found to be having an affair. This time a university president. Apparently the man's son caught footage of his father on his cell phone camera, and well, I think you can imagine how things went from there.</p><img src="http://allisonvesterfelt.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/leaders.jpg"></article>]]></description>
