            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Influence. You Already Have It.</h1><p>"You don't have to be a 'person of influence' to be influential. In fact, the most influential people in my life are probably not even aware of the things they've taught me." -Scott Adams Our lives matter. This is indeed life-giving news to each of us.</p><img src="http://www.becomingminimalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/influence.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Just finished speaking at the #tribeconf so I treated myself to my first paleo donut from @five_daughters_bakery at Honest Roasters Coffee. These donuts are like the elusive ghost I've chased around Nashville but never been in the right place at the right time to snag one. After the first bite I'd say it was totally worth the wait. PS) what we've learned at the conference so far: do what scares you and share your gift, because if you do, you might get a donut... or a Kindle. #youhadtobethere Thanks @jeffgoins and team for your hard work on this event!]]></title>
